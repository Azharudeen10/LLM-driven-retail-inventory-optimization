# LLM-driven-retail-inventory-optimization
An end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. I'm  building a system that can talk to MySQL database. User asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and then executing that query on MySQL database.
